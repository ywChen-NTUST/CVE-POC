## Steps

1. Install Microsoft Office 2013
    - During installation, in the "first in first" step, choose "Ask me later"
2. On the other machine, run `python2 CVE-2023-21716.py` to generate POC file `tezt.rtf`
3. Send the POC file to victim machine (whether using website, ssh, or the others)
4. Double click the `tezt.rtf`

Sometimes it opens normally (As the video shows, I don't know why). Besides from another CVE (CVE-2014-1761), it doesn't meens the POC failed. If you want to see it obviously, try the steps below.

4. Right click the `tezt.rtf` and choose `edit`

The Word.exe will crash now!!!
